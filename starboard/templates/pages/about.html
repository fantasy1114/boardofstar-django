      <p>This contraption was made by <a href="https://www.github.com/rach-sharp">Rachel Sharp</a>, because she realised that masonry.js exists and wanted
        to celebrate never having to faff with .card-columns again. The code is available
        <a href="https://github.com/rach-sharp/starboard">on GitHub</a>.</p>
